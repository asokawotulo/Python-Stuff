### List
Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

1. insert _i e_: Insert integer _e_ at position _i_.
2. print: Print the list.
3. remove _e_: Delete the first occurrence of integer _e_.
4. append _e_: Insert integer _e_ at the end of the list.
5. sort: Sort the list.
6. pop: Pop the last element from the list.
7. reverse: Reverse the list.

Initialize your list and read in the value of _n_ followed by _n_ lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

### Tuples
Given an integer, _n_, and _n_ space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, _t_, of those _n_ integers. Then compute and print the result of _hash(t)_.

----

### List Comprehension
Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers _x_, _y_, and _z_ representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer _n_. You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (_i_,_j_,_k_) on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to _n_. Here, 0 ≤ _i_ ≤ _x_; 0 ≤ _j_ ≤ _y_; 0 ≤ _k_ ≤ _z_

### Second Largest Number
You are given _n_ numbers. Store them in a list and find the second largest number.

----

### Nested Lists
Given the names and grades for each student in a Physics class of _n_ students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

**NOTE**: If there are multiple students with the same grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.
